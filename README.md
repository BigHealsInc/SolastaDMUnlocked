# Solasta DM Unlocked

The Beta version of the Dungeon Maker is extremely restrictive in available monsters, items and traps. This mod opens the floodgates of options from the base game, completely unfiltered access to all the game's resources. Any maps created with this mod require the mod to play the maps.
